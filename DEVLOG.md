# Development Log

## 2025-09-30

### 📚 Documentation Structure Created
Built comprehensive documentation system to help Claude understand the project structure and current state.

**What we created**:
- `/CONTEXT.md` - Main project overview (read this first!)
- `/QUICKSTART.md` - Fast setup guide with essential commands
- Component-specific documentation:
  - `database/own-mal-db/` - CONTEXT.md + ISSUES.md
  - `mcp-servers/anime-search-mcp/` - CONTEXT.md + ISSUES.md
  - `mcp-servers/mal-user-mcp/` - CONTEXT.md + ISSUES.md
  - `mcp-servers/anime-recommendation-mcp/` - CONTEXT.md + ISSUES.md
  - `chat-client/` - CONTEXT.md + ISSUES.md

**Why this helps**:
- Each new Claude conversation can read `/CONTEXT.md` to understand the whole project
- Component-specific CONTEXT.md explains what each part does
- ISSUES.md tracks known problems, todos, and migration needs
- Different Claudes can work on different parts without confusion

### 🔍 Critical Issues Identified

**1. API Migration Needed**
- Database has new v1 API (`/api/v1/*`) with OpenAPI documentation
- MCP servers still using legacy API (`/api/anime/*`)
- Legacy API will be deprecated
- **Action**: Migrate anime-search-mcp and anime-recommendation-mcp to v1 endpoints

**2. Security Concern: MAL OAuth Tokens**
- mal-user-mcp stores OAuth tokens as plain text JSON (`tokens.json`)
- Anyone with filesystem access can read tokens
- **Action**: Implement keyring storage or encrypted file storage

**3. Recommendation MCP Not Complete**
- anime-recommendation-mcp is work-in-progress
- Tools implemented but untested
- No PostgreSQL connection yet
- Pattern discovery system exists but needs validation
- **Action**: Complete PostgreSQL integration, test all tools

### 🏗️ Monorepo Structure

Successfully organized everything into single workspace:
```
mal-workspace/
├── database/own-mal-db/          # PostgreSQL + REST API
├── mcp-servers/
│   ├── anime-search-mcp/         # Search & browse tools
│   ├── mal-user-mcp/             # MAL account management
│   └── anime-recommendation-mcp/ # Smart recommendations (WIP)
└── chat-client/                  # CLI client (→ web app planned)
```

**Benefits**:
- Everything in one place
- Easy to find and navigate
- Shared dependencies possible
- Clear component boundaries

### 🌐 Chat Client Evolution

Documented plan to evolve CLI test client into web application:
- Current: Terminal-based interactive menu for testing
- Future: Web chat interface with AI integration
- Vision: ChatGPT-style interface specialized for anime
- Timeline: 10-12 week migration plan documented

### 📋 Workflow Established

**New conversation workflow**:
1. "Read `/CONTEXT.md`" → Understand whole project
2. "Read `component/CONTEXT.md`" → Understand specific part
3. "Read `component/ISSUES.md`" → See todos and known issues

**Working on specific component**:
- Claude reads component-specific docs
- Knows context, limitations, and current state
- Can work independently without confusion

### 🎯 Next Steps

**Immediate priorities**:
1. Migrate anime-search-mcp to v1 API
2. Migrate anime-recommendation-mcp to v1 API
3. Implement secure token storage for mal-user-mcp
4. Complete and test anime-recommendation-mcp
5. Start planning web application architecture
