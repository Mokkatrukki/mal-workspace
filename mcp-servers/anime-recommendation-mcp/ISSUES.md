# anime-recommendation-mcp - Issues & Roadmap

⚠️ **PROJECT STATUS: WORK IN PROGRESS - MANY FEATURES UNTESTED**

## 🔴 Critical Issues

### ⚠️ PROJECT IS WIP - NOT PRODUCTION READY
**Many features implemented but not tested**

**Current State**:
- ✅ Code structure exists
- ✅ SQLite database working
- ⚠️ Pattern discovery tools untested
- ⚠️ Recommendation engine incomplete
- ❌ PostgreSQL integration missing
- ❌ No end-to-end testing
- ❌ Algorithm logic not validated

**Before Using**:
- Expect bugs and errors
- Data may not persist correctly
- Recommendations may be incorrect
- Tools may fail unexpectedly

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Complete PostgreSQL integration
- [ ] Test all pattern discovery tools
- [ ] Implement recommendation algorithm
- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] Validate pattern matching logic
- [ ] User acceptance testing

### ⚠️ NO POSTGRESQL CONNECTION
**Server isolated from anime data**

**Current State**:
```typescript
// PostgreSQL connection code exists but not integrated
const animeDb = new PostgreSQLConnection(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
// ❌ Not actually used in tools yet
```

**What's Missing**:
- Connection to own-mal-db API
- Should use `/api/v1/*` endpoints (not legacy API)
- Pattern analysis needs review data from PostgreSQL
- Recommendation engine needs anime metadata

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Add HTTP client for own-mal-db v1 API
- [ ] Update endpoints from legacy to v1:
  - `/api/anime/*` → `/api/v1/*`
  - Use `/api/v1/reviews/anime/:id` for reviews
  - Use `/api/v1/reception/anime/:id` for sentiment
  - Use `/api/v1/anime` for anime search
- [ ] Integrate API calls into pattern analysis
- [ ] Test with 111K reviews
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

## ⚠️ High Priority

### Recommendation Engine Incomplete
**Core algorithm not finished**

**What Works**:
- User profile storage ✅
- Pattern storage ✅
- Feedback recording ✅

**What's Missing**:
- Pattern matching algorithm
- Scoring system for recommendations
- Filtering based on preferences
- Ranking logic
- Explanation generation

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Implement pattern matching against reviews
- [ ] Create scoring algorithm
- [ ] Add preference filtering
- [ ] Generate explanations for recommendations
- [ ] Test with real user profiles

### Pattern Discovery Untested
**Tools exist but may not work correctly**

**Implemented but Untested**:
- `saveEmotionalPattern`
- `analyzeReviewForPatterns`
- `runMassPatternAnalysis`
- `updatePatternFromEvidence`
- `validatePatternEvidence`

**Risks**:
- Pattern matching may be inaccurate
- Mass analysis may be too slow
- Evidence tracking may fail
- Validation logic may be wrong

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Unit tests for pattern matching
- [ ] Integration tests with real reviews
- [ ] Performance testing (111K reviews)
- [ ] Accuracy validation
- [ ] Fix bugs discovered

### No Testing Infrastructure
**Zero tests written**

**What's Needed**:
- Unit tests for services
- Integration tests for tools
- Mock data for testing
- Test database setup
- Performance benchmarks

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority

### Dual Database Architecture Incomplete

**SQLite** (User Data) ✅ Working:
- Schema created
- Migrations work
- CRUD operations functional

**PostgreSQL** (Anime Data) ❌ Not Connected:
- Schema exists in `own-mal-db`
- Connection code exists but unused
- API integration missing

**Integration Layer** ❌ Not Built:
- No joins between databases
- No caching strategy
- No sync mechanism

### Pattern Learning Algorithm
**Manual pattern creation only**

**Current**: User manually defines patterns
**Goal**: Automatically discover patterns from reviews

**Research Needed**:
- NLP for emotion detection
- Clustering for pattern discovery
- Validation techniques
- Confidence scoring

### Mood-Based Recommendations
**Mood tracking exists but not used**

**Implemented**:
- `setCurrentMood` - saves mood to DB
- `getCurrentMood` - retrieves mood

**Missing**:
- Mood → pattern mapping
- Mood → filter logic
- Mood history analysis
- Context-aware suggestions

---

## 🟢 Low Priority / Nice to Have

### User Experience

- Better error messages
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Onboarding flow
- Tutorial/examples
- Help system

### Advanced Features

- Collaborative filtering (user similarity)
- Social features (friends' recommendations)
- Watch party suggestions
- Binge-worthiness scoring
- Completion time estimates

### Integration

**With mal-user-mcp**:
- Import MAL list automatically
- Learn from MAL ratings
- Sync recommendations to MAL

**With anime-search-mcp**:
- Search → analyze → save patterns
- Unified recommendation results
- Cross-server caching

---

## ✅ Completed (But Untested)

- ✅ SQLite database schema
- ✅ User profile CRUD
- ✅ Pattern storage schema
- ✅ Feedback recording
- ✅ Mood tracking
- ✅ MCP tool implementations (code exists)
- ✅ Type definitions
