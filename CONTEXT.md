# MAL Workspace - Context for Claude

**Start here every conversation** - This gives you the big picture.

## What Is This?

A complete MyAnimeList (MAL) data ecosystem with AI-powered anime recommendations. Think of it as your personal anime database + search engine + recommendation system + MAL account manager - all designed to work with AI assistants like Claude.

## The 30-Second Summary

You scrape anime data from MAL â†’ store it in PostgreSQL â†’ expose it through MCP servers â†’ Claude (or other AI) can search anime, manage your MAL list, and give personalized recommendations â†’ You can also test it with a chat client.

```
Jikan API â†’ Scrapers â†’ PostgreSQL â†’ MCP Servers â†’ Claude Desktop / Chat Client

                                   AI Recommendations
```

## Project Structure

```
mal-workspace/
â”œâ”€â”€ database/own-mal-db/           # PostgreSQL DB + REST API (5.9K anime, 111K reviews)
â”œâ”€â”€ mcp-servers/                   # AI assistant tools (MCP = Model Context Protocol)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ anime-search-mcp/         # Search, filter, browse anime
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mal-user-mcp/             # Manage your MAL account (OAuth)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ anime-recommendation-mcp/ # Smart recommendations with learning
â””â”€â”€ chat-client/                   # CLI to test everything
```

## The Five Components

| Component | What It Does | One-Liner |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **own-mal-db** | PostgreSQL database + API | Your personal anime data warehouse |
| **anime-search-mcp** | Search & browse tools | "Hey Claude, find me action anime from 2023" |
| **mal-user-mcp** | MAL account integration | "Add this to my watchlist" |
| **anime-recommendation-mcp** | Smart recommendations | Learns your taste, recommends based on mood |
| **chat-client** | Testing interface | Interactive CLI to try everything |

## Current Status

- âœ… Database has 5,900+ anime with 111,000+ reviews
- âœ… All 3 MCP servers working and connected to Claude Desktop
- âœ… Chat client can test all functionality
- ðŸ”¨ Recommendation engine is in active development (pattern learning system)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start database
npm run docker:up
npm run db:dev

# Build all MCP servers
npm run mcp:build-all

# Test with chat client
npm run dev:chat

# Or add to Claude Desktop config:
~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

## When Working On Specific Components

Each component has its own **CONTEXT.md** and **ISSUES.md**:

- Read `database/own-mal-db/CONTEXT.md` when working on the database
- Read `mcp-servers/anime-search-mcp/CONTEXT.md` when working on search
- Read `mcp-servers/mal-user-mcp/CONTEXT.md` when working on MAL integration
- Read `mcp-servers/anime-recommendation-mcp/CONTEXT.md` when working on recommendations
- Read `chat-client/CONTEXT.md` when working on the test client

## The Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Scrapers pull from Jikan API â†’ PostgreSQL
2. **Data Access**: MCP servers expose data as tools for AI
3. **AI Integration**: Claude uses tools to help users find/manage anime
4. **User Interface**: Chat client or Claude Desktop

## Key Technologies

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (anime data) + SQLite (user preferences)
- **MCP SDK**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (AI tool protocol)
- **API**: Express REST API
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+

## Important Files

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Deep technical architecture
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Fast setup guide (see next task)
- `package.json` - Workspace commands (npm run scripts)
- `docker-compose.yml` - Database containers

## Data Highlights

- **5,900+ anime** with full metadata (titles, genres, episodes, scores)
- **111,000+ reviews** with sentiment analysis
- **Reception data** - polarization scores, sentiment patterns
- **Seasonal tracking** - current and upcoming anime

## Development Philosophy

- **Monorepo**: Everything in one place, easy to find
- **MCP-first**: Built for AI assistants from the ground up
- **Local-first**: Your data, your control (no external API dependencies)
- **Learning system**: Recommendation engine learns from your feedback

## What Makes This Special?

1. **Complete data ownership** - You control the database
2. **AI-native** - Built specifically for AI assistants
3. **Smart recommendations** - Not just "similar anime", learns your emotional preferences
4. **Real MAL integration** - Actually updates your MAL account
5. **Pattern discovery** - Finds emotional patterns in reviews to understand appeal
